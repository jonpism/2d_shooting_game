# 2d_shooting_game
I created with pygame, a simple 2d, 2-player shooting game. Each player has his health status appear on the screen, and it decreases of course when gets hit by a bullet until it reaches zero and then a message appears that shows the winner. After 5 seconds, the winner message dissapears and the game restarts.
